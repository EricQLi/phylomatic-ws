<h3>Background</h3>

<p>As part of ongoing research into the phylogenetic
structure of plant communities, we (<a href="http://www.phylodiversity.net/cwebb">Cam Webb</a> and <a href="http://www.eeb.yale.edu/faculty/donoghue">Michael Donoghue</a>)
began assembling published phylogenies into a 'mega-tree' of all the taxa
in communities that we are interested in.  Now all angiosperm families
are included.  This tree
of trees is not a true supertree (e.g.,
Sanderson, Purvis and Henze 1998), in that it is being assembled 'by
hand,' rather than by an automated supertree algorithm, and
conflicting branching patterns are being resolved 'subjectively.'  It
is, however, intended to represent a good current approximation of
the true tree of higher plants (minus reticulations!).  This is
obviously something of a rough-and-ready process, conducted for pragmatic
expediency.  To be absolutely clear:</p>

<p></p><center><font color="#FF0000"><h3>*** This a constantly-changing,
working hypothesis.  Use at your own
risk! ***</h3></font></center><p></p>

<p>This work complements rather than competes with more comprehensive
collections of trees, such as the <a href="http://tolweb.org/tree/phylogeny.html">Tree of Life</a> project,
and <a href="http://treebase.bio.buffalo.edu/treebase/">TreeBASE</a>.</p>

<p> As a service to the larger biological community, we are making our
mega-trees available as we put them together.  We supply online software
(Phylomatic) for users to rapidly assemble their own community trees
from our mega-tree.  The main limitation for users is that the taxa you are
interested in must appear in the mega-tree (at genus or family
level).  You can help us in this growing project by requesting that
taxa be added (and suggesting relevant phylogenies).  <a href="mailto:campbell.webb@yale.edu">Comments</a> on the website and
on the process are valued.</p>

<a name="rules"><h3>Mega-tree construction rules</h3></a>

<p>Since Peter Stevens has put his (dynamic) hypothesis for the
phylogenetic relationship among the APG orders (on <a href="http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/">APweb</a>), we have been
using this as the backbone of our mega-tree, and are extremely
grateful for his effort.  We had previously been compiling our tree
from the most recent 'whole angiosperm' study, e.g. Soltis et
al. (2000). Peter has extensively documented his sources for tree
construction down to the family level.</p>

<p>Our 'resolved' trees (name prefixed by 'R') use the complete
resolution that Peter has decided on on APweb.  Our 'conservative'
trees (name prefixed by 'C') remove any branches that Peter has
annotated as having bootstrap support less that 80%, or when a whole
tree is indicated as having 'weak support.'</p>

<p>To the APweb tree, we are adding family-level phylogenies from
published studies.  Our method for deciding which tree to include is:

</p><ol>
<li>Where a single most parsimonious tree is presented, this topology
is used for our 'resolved' tree.  The 'conservative' tree is based on
the strict consensus tree given, with branches of support less than
80% removed.</li> 

<li>Where parsimony and
maximum likelihood analyses are both presented, the former result is
used, not as a statement about the relative merit of the two
approaches, but for consistency.</li> 

<li>The results from a more
focused study (on particular nodes at any taxonomic level) over-rides
conflicting results of a broader study (for the ingroup only).</li>

<li>Studies using a greater number of informative characters are given
dominance over studies with fewer characters.</li> 

<li>Where no
molecular or morphological phylogenetic analyses have been published,
sub-familial classification and authors' published 'intuitions' about
relationships are used in the 'resolved' tree.</li>
</ol>
<p></p><br>

<h3>The Current megatrees</h3> 

<p>Because the tree has grown so large, I am maintaining it as a
series of plain text newick files.  The current compiled trees are:
</p><ul>
<li><b><a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/trees/R20040402.new">Resolved</a></b></li>
<li><b><a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/trees/C20040402.new">Conservative</a></b></li>
</ul><p></p><br>

<a name="davies"><h3>The Davies et al tree</h3></a>

Thanks again to Jonathan for sharing this. See <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10.1073/pnas.0308127100"> Davies et
al. (2004)</a> for info on branch support.  A number of terminals in
the paper were composites of several families, and I substituted these
families in as monophyletic polytomies in the <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/davies.new">consensus tree</a>, but collapsed them back to the
last node in the <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/davies_dated.new">dated tree</a>.  Note that
the branch lengths from the terminals (family names) represent MAXIMUM
ages for those clades - use with care!<br>

<h3>Megatree archives</h3>
<p>We intend to make all significant revisions of the tree available.
Thus users can cite the tree version number in publications:
</p><ul>
<li>Tree L20011010 (or R20011010). Available as a <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/trees/R20011010.new">Newick</a> file, and a <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/trees/R20011010.nex">Nexus</a> file.  The numbers refer to
<a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/tot-notes.txt">notes</a> and <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/tot-refs.txt">references</a> used in the construction of this tree.  Family names are
attached as terminals, with a '-' before the name, to the interior node
that corresponds to the family.</li>
<li>Tree L20020928 (or R20020928). <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/trees/R20020928.nex">Nexus</a>.</li>
<li>Tree L20030804 (or R20030804). <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/trees/R20030804.new">Newick</a>.</li>
<li>Tree L20031115 (or R20031115). <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/trees/R20031115.new">Newick</a>.</li>
<li>Tree R20031202 <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/trees/R20031202.new">Newick</a>, and Tree

</ul><p></p><br>

<h3>Phylomatic</h3>
<p>The online software takes your list of taxa, and first tries to
match them by genus name to the megatree.  Failing that, they are
attached by family name.  If all the genera appear in the megatree,
then that family appears resolved.  If even one genus is missing from
the megatree, the returned phylogeny portrays a polytomy of genera.
Currently, species are not included in the megatree, and species
within a genus are always returned as polytomies.</p><br>


<h3>'To do' list</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Branch lengths</b>  Using fossil dates for important nodes, and
rate smoothing to make the tree ultrametric, we hope to soon offer
output trees with meaningful branch lengths.  See <a href="http://www.phylodiversity.net/bladj">Bladj</a></li>
<li>Add an option to add 'unfound' genera to the base of resolved
genera, rather than polymomizing all genera.</li>
<li>Add another option to drop out unresolved genera from the input list</li>
</ul><p></p><br>


<h3>Bibliography</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb">APweb</a>
contains an enormous and up-to-date bibliography.  Additional articles
