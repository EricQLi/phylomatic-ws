      <h2>Phylomatic 2</h2>
      <p>
      Over the years, the web-interface of phylomatic has seen a lot
      of use.  However, I'm sure you have found it frustrating that
      within-family resolution is generally missing.  Our goal with
      phylomatic, way back, was to keep on top of the literature and
      add clades to the megatree on a regular basis.  This was clearly
      an unrealistic expectation.  However, the need is still here for
      a tool for easily assembling phylogenies for communities and
      other lists of plants.  I have now developed a work-plan that
      opens the assembly of the tree-of-trees database to users of
      phylomatic.  If there are particular clades that are not yet
      well resolved in the database, please consider adding the newick
      version of a suitable published tree to the public database of
      trees.  I know that several researchers have started with a
      backbone tree from phylomatic and then added better resolution
      for additional clades, and I suspect that there was much
      repetition of work because there was no way to share the
      refinements that users made to the megatree.  Now we can all
      work together on making a usable, flexible hypothesis for the
      phylogeny of plants.
      </p>

      <p>
	The components of `Phylomatic2' are:
	</p><ul>
	  <li>
	    A
	    standardized <a href="http://svn.phylodiversity.net/tot/doc/coding_phylogenies.txt">protocol</a>
	    for encoding trees into newick.  This includes the choice
	    of a permanent name (within the domain of phylomatic) for
	    key interior nodes.  We would like to use, where possible,
	    APG and/or PhyloCode-accepted names.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    An XML-format 
<a href="http://svn.phylodiversity.net/tot/pmmd/template.xml">metadata
	    file</a> to accompany each newick tree.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    An openly readable,
	    text-based <a href="http://svn.phylodiversity.net/tot/trees/">data
	    repository</a> for the trees, using
	    the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
	    versioning system (to download the database, install an
	    SVN client and type <code>svn checkout
	    http://svn.phylodiversity.net/tot/trees</code>). If you
	    are interested in contributing significantly and helping
	    to fix errors in the database, please ask me for a SVN
	    user account.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Submission of user-transcribed trees and metadata files
	    via email
	    (<a href="mailto:newick {AT} phylodiversity {DOT} net">newick
	    {AT} phylodiversity
	    {DOT}
	    net</a>), or by direct SVN checkin, for registered users.
	    Please note that it may take a few days to weeks
	    for email-submitted trees to be incorporated into the data
	    repository (depending on how busy the tree curators are).
	    However, this does not stop the users incorporating their
	    new trees into their local copy of the database
	    immediately, to generate the megatree that they need. 
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Once a local copy of the database has been downloaded, a
	    <a href="http://svn.phylodiversity.net/tot/trees/makemega.config">configuration
	    file</a> permits selection of alternate clade
	    representations that might coexist in the database.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    A
	    simple <a href="http://svn.phylodiversity.net/tot/tools/makemega">GAWK
	    script</a> is  then run to assemble a single megatree,
	    based on configuration options.  Alternatively, see the directory <a href="http://svn.phylodiversity.net/tot/megatrees/">http://svn.phylodiversity.net/tot/megatrees/</a> for recently compiled trees.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    This megatree is then ready for processing the taxon name
	    list the user supplies, with the <code>phylomatic</code>
	    program that comes in
	    the <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylocom"><code>phylocom</code></a>
	    bundle.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      <p></p>

      <p><i>Phylomatic2 and TreeBase</i> If you contribute to this
      project, you will be concerned that your efforts in transcribing
      and describing trees are not lost at some point in the future.
      We have always considered phylomatic a pragmatic solution to a
      real need, but one whose functions will one day be included in a
      more sophisticated tool, the obvious choice being <a href="http://www.treebase.org/">TreeBase</a>.  I have discussed
      the components of Phylomatic2 with Bill Piel, and, with a
      translation script, our PMMD metadata structure should be
      acceptable to the TreeBase database too, allowing dumping of
      appropriate trees from our tree database directly into TreeBase.
      What we can't offer, obviously, is the original data matrices.
      </p>
	
      <p><i>Phylomatic2 and APweb</i> The ordinal-level
      trees in Phylomatic are those displayed in Peter Steven's
      <a href="http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/">APweb</a>,
      the foremost internet resource for plant systematic information.
      I am in discussion with Peter, Amy Zanne, and others, about
      possibly converting APweb from a `flat' data store to a
      phylogenetically-structured database, that could link directly to
      Phylomatic2.  Watch this space! </p>

      <p><i>Additional tree coding</i> If you are aware of a published
      phylogeny that will help resolve a clade you need for your
      research, but which you do not have time or desire to transcribe
      yourself, please feel free to request that we transcribe it for
      you.  Thanks to funding from NESCent (see below), we have the
      capacity to speed up the transcription process with assistants.
      Please send a PDF of the paper containing the phylogeny, and an
      indication of which figure you need transcribed,
      to <a href="mailto:newick {AT} phylodiversity {DOT} net">newick
      {AT} phylodiversity {DOT} net.</a>

      <h2>Funding</h2>
      <p>Original funds for Phylomatic came from a Donnelley
      Fellowship of the <a href+"http:="" www.yale.edu="" yibs="" "="">Yale
      Institute of Biospheric Studies</a>.  Subsequently, I have been
      supported by the NSF (DEB-0212873), and am now gratefully
      employed by
      the <a href="http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/">Arnold Arboretum
      of Harvard University</a>.  A
      recent <a href="http://www.nescent.org/">NESCent</a> working
      group (co-sponsored by the ARC-NZ Research Network for
      Vegetation Function), permitted CW and Peter Stevens to meet
      and discuss APweb2.  A subsequent small grant from NESCent is
      enabling the coding of phylogenies by a dedicated team of
      Indonesians.</p>
